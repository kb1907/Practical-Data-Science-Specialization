## WHAT  I LEARNED
------------------------

- I learned foundational concepts for exploratory data analysis (EDA), automated machine learning (AutoML), and text classification algorithms. 
- With Amazon SageMaker Clarify and Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, I analyzed a dataset for statistical bias, transform the dataset into machine-readable features, and select the most important features to train a multi-class text classifier.
- I performed automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically train, tune, and deploy the best text-classification algorithm for the given dataset using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot.
- I worked with Amazon SageMaker BlazingText, a highly optimized and scalable implementation of the popular FastText algorithm, to train a text classifier with very little code.



## There are 3 Courses in this Specialization
--------------------------------------------------

## [Course 1 - Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML](https://github.com/kb1907/Practical-Data-Science-Specialization/tree/main/Course1_Analyze-Datasets-AutoML)

- [In the first course of the Practical Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning),
