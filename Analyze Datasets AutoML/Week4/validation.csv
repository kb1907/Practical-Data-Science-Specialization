( it seems to only come in two colors though . ) soft flowy fabric is lined with a soft inner fabric as well . super flattering for any body type !"
__label__1 "very cute dress for 5 ' 5 or taller"
__label__-1 "this dress looks lovely on the model but it looks just awful on me ! i am 5 ' 4 and curvy . the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape . instead of a cap sleeve it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders . it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space . the material is nice and the sequins are pretty but the cut of the dress is unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i would n't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75 % less . they are so cheaply constructed . one wash and they 're all but guaranteed to shrink . the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer . they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them ."
__label__-1 "when i saw this top online i thought i 'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors . they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed . i have never seen such drab colors . the blue is a muddy grayish hue ( like an overcast day ) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach . yuck . and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect . instead the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit . back these go ..."
__label__1 "this dress is a great casual outfit . tha fabric is substantial and very soft . the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms . i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium . sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it !"
__label__1 "i have so many compliments on this blouse . i love the style and design . i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 58 tall . i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it wo n't look right in the back kinda hang out . otherwise really nice quality blouse . i would definitely buy another just to have a back up ."
__label__-1 "yikes . there is a whole lot of skirt here . i am 54 weigh around 120 lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer . this skirt balloons out from the waist . on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist . i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking . the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf . there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect . definitely returning ."
__label__1 "not what i was expecting but pleasantly surprised . was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser but these are closer to leggings albeit very substantial ones with real pant touches like a zip/button front and ( faux ) pockets . they 're form fitting soft yet supportive stretchy incredibly comfortable and tts . i 'm a pretty legit 10 in pants ( 30/31 ) and the 10 's near perfect with the rise coming right to my belly button . think i 'll grab another pair now while they 're available ."

__label__-1 "i would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure . these pants seem to be cut straight up and down . the fabric is not soft the color is slightly more muted in person and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model ."

__label__0 "first of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl . the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways . if you wear it so it 's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa . my only big complaint is that i 've worn it twice and there 's already a large hole in the arm seam . poor construction which is disappointing . hopefully mine was a one-off . i 'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale ."

__label__1 "these were as great in person as i had hoped ; great color for fall super comfy and flattering fit . happy with my purchase !"
__label__-1 "i thought it would be heavier than it is . it 's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater ( it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer ) . it 's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too ."
__label__-1 "i read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me but it did not . i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big . it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame . overall it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else ! if you 're tall and slender i think this top would work !"
__label__1 "this cape is stunning ! the perfect addition to any closet . it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans . the fur is so soft and the quality is superior . it has real fur hooks ( four ) to close it and the side pockets are adorable . definitely a buy and a bargain on sale !"

__label__-1 "i have to agree with the first reviewer ! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i could n't justify it for the price . i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well but just could n't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes ! i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews"

__label__0 "this is a pretty dress although it runs smaller and the colors are n't as vibrant as on the website . the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure . this probably will look very nice on someone smaller ."

__label__-1 "let me start off by saying how pretty this top is and heavy .and itchy ! you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top ( with your arms not touching any part of the top ! the sequins will itch if you put your arms down ( underneath the armhole ) . another reason i did n't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable . i would have to get mine tailored for my 5 ' 2 frame . i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium it was roomy ."
__label__-1 "as another reviewer noted the upper portion ( back chest shoulders etc . ) fit nicely . however the body of the dress was enormous and did indeed make me look much heavier throughout the middle . back to the store it goes ."
__label__-1 "the dress is very pretty but the sequins are dark blue ! i imagined they would be silver/gold given the photo but the dress is essentially light pink and blue ."
__label__1 "this is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy . i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra ca n't be seen underneath with it great if you do n't feel like wearing multiple layers ."
__label__0 "i order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down . when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled . therefore i knew it would have to ironed a lot . it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back . i did n't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics . overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite ."

__label__-1 "the design is very strange . the inner slip is quite form-fitting but the dress on top was just massive like a sack . on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with . they looked weird just hanging off the side so i tried to knot them like a belt . overall this dress was not attractive on . it looks much better on the model . the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life harsher red blue and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured ."

__label__-1 "this dress fit so oddly . i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly . the dress was n't tight at my hips in either size it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out . maybe i was too short ? could n't figure it out . the color and detailing are beautiful though ! a little tight in the bust ."

__label__0 "i loved the look of this top when i saw it online however when i received it i was kinda disappointed . the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially . .it 's way more off white . .. not my favorite . the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me . the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful but not enough for me to keep . unfortunately i will be returning this one . not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love !"

__label__1 "feminine and lovely flutters indeed . i am on the fence . i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right . given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear ."
__label__1 "i just love this top it has a flattering cut fun summer colors ! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt . both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down . perfect for traveling . only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back . highly recommend ! ! stock more pieces like this retailer !"

__label__1 "my mother who is not a dress person ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills . we 'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress and she 'd returned three other options ( different stores ) . after admiring this dress for awhile she decided to try it and is so happy she did ! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images but that 's what she was hoping for . it fits wonderfully and looks extremely elegant ."

__label__0 "i ordered the pink and it was gorgeous . the color and feel were so soft i would have kept it if it were a blanket . but i did send it back because as a sweater it just did n't lay right . it has a sort of inside layer that just did n't fit right with the outside sweater layer so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist . that was not flattering . and the hood was too large and floppy looking . too bad ."
__label__-1 "this item is huge . i 'm normally a medium sized down to a small still massive . could n't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest . but the sleeves are very wide as is the waist . way too much fabric . i had high hopes for this one but it just does n't work . for reference i love billowy and flowy tops but this was a tent ."
__label__1 "i sized down from my typical size small . beautiful detail on the back . slightly sheer in front but dark bra or cami fixes that . shorter in front than back but not too short . goes with jeans and pants plus a shorter cardigan or denim jacket would look great ."
__label__1 "another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet ! i adore the print it reminds me of morocco . i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband . i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead . i 'm not going to return it but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey ."

__label__1 "this is a love at first sight item ! bought that home after seeing it on the model . very soft and lovely ! especially love the tie back ! i wore it with a t shirt underneath . i am 5 ' 4 and size small . i bought xs and still a bit long . wish they have petite at the store ."
__label__-1 "the pattern and colors are very pretty and the material is soft and silky . i returned it though because it is very low-cut in the front . it comes down to between my breasts which is not going to work for me ."

__label__1 "i 'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down . for reference i am 5 ' 7 and generally a size 8 or m in dresses . the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way but a medium would have swallowed me . otherwise it 's a great casual piece . the material is light and soft and it 's cute over leggings ."

__label__1 "i saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it . it is as one of the reviewers said like having two dresses in one . the bottom dress is a full dress and the top lays over it not quite skimming but not quite loose either . i love the dress as i am a pear shaped size 14 and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely . this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries ."

__label__-1 "i was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium boy is it huge the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable even the small would be giant ! for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am . the colours are true and nice and vibrant ... definitely size down with this one"

__label__0 "i had really high hopes for this dress and i am still unsure if i 'll keep it or not . i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand . the small fit ( im usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b 140 lb 5 ' 8 ) just like it does on the model only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress . this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly . also the colors should be more like blue multi because there 's a bright a"

__label__0 "i really like the dress the material the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun . however the neckline is a bit to low and a cami is necessary at least for me . the material is very sheer which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee ) .the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off . there are no zippers or buttons . getting it on is easy not so when taking it off !"

__label__0 "i love the idea of ruffles but this shirt was huge ! i normally wear a small or medium and i got the small . it felt more like a large to me . maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes it will work out for you . i 'm going to take it back rather than exchange . i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer but it 's pretty thick ."
__label__0 "i want to like and keep . at this price point i cant justify keeping . if it does go to clearance i will reorder . due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating . true to size . i ordered a medium and am 5 ' 9 and 155 pounds ."
__label__0 "this dress is very pretty in person . it fits true to size and is very figure flattering . one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage . my only gripe with this dress is that it 's a little rough and stiff feeling . i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft . it probably works for most people but not for me so had to go back ."

__label__-1 "this bunches up too much and the fabric is even more see through than i expected ( so even with a tank top under it it 's not a good look for work ) . even unbuttoned at the top i could barely get this over my head ! this one is going back ."
__label__-1 "i do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things ! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person it just looks awful ! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn . it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall it is just a wrinkly mess . another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree . it looks very shabby . it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon"
__label__1 "just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top . the colors are pretty and vibrant . i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top . dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back . it looks fantastic with jeans . as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it . it 's an all year round top . throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go . a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it ."
__label__1 "i love anna sui 's lines makeup to everything . this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on i could n't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow . the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big . the hem is lovely scalloped . each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress there is no wow that justifies the full price tag . now that it 's on sale i 'll keep it probably for summer ."
__label__0 "beautiful dress with the colors and pleats . i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did . my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn & # 39 ; t lay flat even when just hanging on the hanger . when actually on a person the zipper juts out . had to be returned !"

__label__-1 "i thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me . i actually did n't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i did n't want to keep it for 1 look . the material felt inexpensive . the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself . i 'm 5 ' 8 and about 160 lbs ."

__label__0 "this top runs small across the top . i was amazed at the material -- polyester i am sure -- because the price was so high . it has a sheer layer underneath which i think would make it hot in the summer . i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online ."
__label__0 "i like the idea of the dress just not the fit in the bust . i 'm not particularly big ( 32c ) but it just did n't fit up there . i wish the dress had built in support because you ca n't really wear a bra ."
__label__0 "had to send back for exchange . way too big . i 'm very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made ."
__label__1 "i think it 's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket . it 's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold ."

__label__-1 "i received this dress in the mail yesterday . right away i noticed the coloring was n't quite the same as it appears in the images online . in person the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny as opposed to more muted . i was willing to look past that but then i tried it on . i ordered a small which is my typical size in retailer dresses . it ran quite large and was way to long for me ( i am 5 ' 4 '' ) . overall between the coloring and sizing this dress was n't a hit for me ."

__label__0 "i found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline ; however the fabric feels cheap and does n't drape as nicely as i 'd hope for the price . this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric . for sizing reference i 'm 5 ' 5 '' 122 lbs 30dd and took my usual size xs - though i 'm busty for my size the top provides nice coverage ."
__label__1 "i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice . the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased . overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here . the 0 ( or xs ca n't remember ) fit me at 115 lbs with 30dd chest ."

__label__0 "got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black . quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat . a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down . not worth full price ."
__label__-1 "i was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo . however upon arrival i was completely disappointed . the color is much more drab than the photo . the smudged polkadots were n't attractive . there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen . the dress is super heavy . the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly . and it adds 10 pounds to your hips ! super sad ! i am sending it back ."

__label__0 "the fit is gorgeous but i did n't realize it was completely transparent . when it says mesh it means mesh ! i was thinking the mesh part was on the bottom . because of how it is cut high on the shoulders you ca n't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage . very cute but not practical ."
__label__-1 "this top looked positively vulgar on ! ! ! ! i am a 34d and it was way too low cut ... my boobs were spilling out ! ! ! in addition the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth ..... it just looked and felt cheap . unfortunately this top will be going back ."
__label__1 "this yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person . i actually do n't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow but i could n't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect ! the silhouette is very feminine especially around the neckline & shoulders . there is a lot of fabric but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive . finally the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it . looking forward to summer !"
__label__-1 "i 've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i 've ever posted a bad review . first of all the fabric is scratchy thin and looks very cheap . second of all there is no v back it 's more of a slight scoop . and lastly i 'm 5 ' 3 so i ordered the petite small and it 's still comes 4 inches below my knee . i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back . the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup ."

__label__-1 "after reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model . the dress they sent me is not this dress . it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter like a cross . there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer . it was scoop and if you pulled it down the neck went up . the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here is rava . the length measured at 39 not the st"

( i ended up with the 12 ) . i wear a 32 dd bra so usually braless is not an option but this actually offers enough support . and if i do want to wear a bra it 's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it . it 's super flattering and really fun to wear out day or night ."
__label__-1 "beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me . where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am . same with the arms if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams . i 'm 5 ' 6 and a classic size 8 and this"

__label__0 "those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast . this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture . also the material is quite thin which makes the snug part look unflattering . they were not for me unfortunately ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress . it is super soft and flattering for my body type ( petite and curvy ) . though i wish it did come in petite as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better . but that did n't stop me from purchasing as that 's an easy alteration . very flattering . love it ."
__label__1 "love the coral color - so pretty in person . it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected . this is a great top for the weekends !"
__label__0 "i bought the orange color . i had a hard time styling it as it is so long . since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve you 'll need a jacket or sweater on top . nothing looked right . it has a relatively high and tight neck so sweaters looked weird . short jackets did n't work either . i 'm 5 ' 4 and bought the small . returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
__label__0 "i am returning . i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua but the biggest problem for me is the shape . it 's pretty boxy and it 's hard to tell from the photo but it has a batwing shape . i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory ( less yellow in it ) but that 's based on what looks better against my skin tone . i found it to run true to size but i thought it was unflattering ( made me look wide ) ."
__label__1 "i definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender . the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem . but it is somewhat boxy and flowy which did n't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise ."
__label__0 "i waited and got this sweater at the winter sale . i ordered the navy in a medium . the design is pretty but as has been said i was surprised at how short it is . i do love the detail the tie back . nice weight . i have not found it to be itchy . the sweater i received was a store return and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy but for $ 35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over . i do need to wear a cami underneath as the sides are more revealing than pictures . the first day"

__label__0 "i took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print . it is mostly as pictured but because i have a larger chest the peplum did n't hit me in the right place . it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest . i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer which was disappointing considering the price . i returned it ."
__label__1 "this dress is really lovely in person . the fit was perfect and the length not too short . for reference i 'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit ! ( i 'm an xl usually and the fit was tts ) the only thing i 'm not crazy about is the slip it 's more of a flesh toned color . i 'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these retailer !"

__label__0 "this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline . but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area -- so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty . a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just did n't feel comfortable about . some darts could have made a nicer fit here . but this is a a great dress if you do n't mind a super body con fit ."

__label__0 "the fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it . my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm so if you are n't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm it will show ... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders"

__label__1 "i 've only worn the sweater a handful of times but i 'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is . it 's a bit on the baggier side but that does n't stop it from looking great . i 've gotten complements on it every time i 've worn it . i would highly recommend it to people who do n't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles ."
__label__1 "the first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric did n't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue . i 'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage which was a nice surprise because i usually avoid anything with fullness . will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect . i 'm short 5 ' 3 . neckline is fem"
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online . i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered it was comical . so so boxy . literally shaped like a square . it must be pinned back on this model . maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked ... or perhaps for a larger person it may look super cute ! just did n't work on my slim build . : ("
__label__1 "i purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top . the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute . unfortunately it made my chest look too big ... but the quality is really nice and i 'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types ."
__label__0 "ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online . runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric . i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol . i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on . the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though ! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering !"
__label__-1 "three strikes and retailer is out for me ! i am so disappointed . i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun distinctive new shift dress . got it tried it on took it off went back to look at the listing online ... nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders . i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image but it 's not mentioned in the text . who on god 's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder ? ! it hits every woman under 5'10 right in the middl"
__label__1 "the tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look . it fits well to the body even better than pictured . very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring ."
__label__1 "a slip underneath makes this dress substantial . it 's a good 'weather ' transition dress-fall/spring . the lace is very pretty and it 's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere . i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend ."
__label__1 "this shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants . it 's a great shirt !"
__label__-1 "i noticed this top on one of the sales associates and it looked great . she 's probably 230lbs and about 5 ' 5 . tried it on and it looked horrible i even tried sizing down twice . i 'm 5 ' 8 and the ruffles started right under my chest . i gave 2 stars bc of the material it is light and summery ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this jump suit . i rarely have problem with retailer clothing . i 'm 5.6 hourglass shape usually wear size 2. this jumpsuit runs small but that 's not the only problem . top part ( shirt piece of the jumpsuit ) is too short so it 's digging into my lady part . the color does not look anything like the picture so overall this piece is failure . i hope that i find something similar but fits better ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing . this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black . the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple . lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship . i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large . will return ."
